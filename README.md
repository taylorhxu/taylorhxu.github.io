# About

This is my personal website running with jekyll and hosted on Github pages. 

Also if I were you I wouldn't pay too much attention to how everything
is implemented here as I plan on dropping everything and starting again
from scratch at some point.

## Setting it up

```
git clone https://github.com/marcgg/marcgg.github.com.git
cd marcgg.github.com
```

Accept rvmrc prompt

```
sudo easy_install Pygments
bundle install
jekyll --server
```

Access http://localhost:4000/ to see the blog
