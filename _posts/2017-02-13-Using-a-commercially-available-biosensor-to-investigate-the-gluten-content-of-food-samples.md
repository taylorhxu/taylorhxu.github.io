The experiment was carried out to detect if there is gluten in given samples. A simple lateral flow device (LFD) was used, drops of sample solutions were added using pipettes to LFD, and positive results were shown from two of the samples. During the experiment, hands on experience of using a biosensor was achieved, as well as the understanding of the theoretical and technical aspects of a novel biosensor design. A clearer understanding of the bio-recognition elements, transducer and signal processing was archived from the background research on the topic. The aspects of biosensors and the difference between biosensors and biomedical sensors are understood, as well as the principle of how a Lateral Flow Device works, and the importance of Surface Plasmon Resonance in Biosensor Development.### BiosensorsA biosensor is an analytical device, used for the detection of an analyte, that combines a biological component with a physio-chemimcal detector. It converts a biological response into an electrical signal, by having a bio-receptor and transducer, and signal processor, the completed association between biosensor reader and electronics are primarily responsible for the display of the results in a user-friendly way. The applications of biosensors would include glucose monitoring, microbial biosensors, ozone biosensors and metastatic cancer cell biosensors.### Biomedical SensorsHowever, a biomedical sensor is a sensor designed and configured for use in the biomedical regime, it may be a physical or chemical sensor, it is designed to be safe and to meet standards of testing and evaluation for use on people. The applications of biomedical sensors include the following: blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, as well as the corresponding chemical sensors for pO2, SvO2 and Lipids. Biomedical sensors are widely used in many areas, for instance, drug delivery, gastroenterology, neurology and many more. ### Biosensors vs. Biomedical SensorsThe difference between biosensors and biomedical sensors is that biomedical sensors are used specifically in biomedical applications, whereas biosensors’ target can be biological, chemical and physical.### Components in BiosensorsThe three main components of biosensors are: 1.	Biological elements2.	Transducer3.	Signal processor The main purpose of biosensors is to conduct quantitative analysis of various substances by converting the biological actions in to measurable signals [1].The biological element is the element that can interact with target analyte, for example, tissue enzymes. Enzymes are acting as a bioreceptor, and they rae capable of recognising a specific target molecule. Antibodies, nucleic acids are the comment bioreceptors. The biological component recognises and interacts with the analyte to produce a physical change (a signal) that can be detected, by the transducer.Transducers can convert the recognised events into measurable signals and can be more easily quantified.

And the final step is that signal processor that can display the results, for easy interpretation. ### Gluten As a mixture of proteins found in wheat and grains, the specific molecule that’s present in gluten is Prolamin, and can be divided into two main components: gliadins and glutenins. [2]### The Experiment ### Apparatus Glutentox Home Gluten Test Kit•	Extraction solution•	Dilution solution•	Spoon•	Pipettes•	Gluten Biosensor The procedure was carried out by following the steps:1.

![](/images/glu/3.png)Biscuit crumb and flour were given as testing samples, small spoons are provided, to get same amount of each samples for the experiment. ### TestingDuring the experiment, separate pipettes are used to prevent contamination between samples, as the image shown below. 

![](/images/glu/4.png)As the prolamin molecules are only present in gluten, in the Glutentox Home sensor, an antibody G12 is to target this molecule. The G12 antibody created to target specific gluten molecule, it recognises gluten in wheat, barley, rye and some strains of oat [3].Based on the steps provided on the lab sheet, the purpose of the liquid inside extraction bottle is to dissolve solvent in order to form a well-mixed solution, by shaking the bottle vigorously. By adding solutions to the dilution bottle,  the solution is diluted, the purpose of doing so is to control the concentration of analyte that is to be detected. At the same time, it is also to make sure that the concentration of the sample is within the range of Glutentox Home Kit – 5ppm to 20ppm [3].### ResultsIn comparison to the test indicator guide, all three tests are valid.

With the sample that contains flour, gluten is present, as the red line on the sensor indicates. However, there were visible changes that was observed when the sample was heated before testing, the intensity of the result is equal in both heated and unheated test, however, the speed of intensity change is faster in heated sample than unheated. With the heated flour, the particles in the sample travelled faster than the unheated sample to the Report Stripe, therefore a more intense and quicker response was given by the sensor.As we can see on the senor, there are two visible stripes present: blue and red. The change of colour in the stripes is caused by the localised Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) of colloidal gold [4]. ### Discussion### Lateral Flow DevicesLateral flow tests are known as lateral flow immunochromatographic assays, they are devices for the detection of the presence or absence of a target analyte in samples. The advantage of such device is it can function without the need for specialised equipment, and its low cost. Lateral Flow Device is used to detect presence or absence of target analyte without the need for costly equipment or external reading devices.![](/images/glu/7.png)

Lateral flow test consists of the following major components:Sample pad – holds excess of sample fluid, sponge-like material that absorbs sample and allows flow to conjugate pad.Conjugate (detector) or reagent pad – the main role of conjugate pad is to hold the detector particles and make sure they are functionally stable until the test is performed. The pad contains antibodies specific to the target analyte conjugated to colour particles.Control stripe (blue colour) – is the stripe that captures particles and shows that the reaction conditions and the test is operating correctly, by having an antibody that would pick up free particles. It is used to confirm chemical reaction has successfully achieved. Reaction conjugate – typically Nitro-cellulose membrane, Material has stripes of immobilised molecules. Sample –conjugate mix is bound by these molecules when it reaches different stripes dependant in sample composition.Report stripe (red colour) – contains a specific capture molecule that only captures particles onto which an analyte molecule has reacted to. It is activated when sample reaches stripe and has presence of target analyte. Intensity increases as amount of sample that binds accumulates. Wick pad – a further absorbent pad that is used for drawing the sample across the reaction conjugate by capillary action, it acts as a waste container. Plastic-adhesive backing card – provides support to sensor components.Absorbent (sink) pad – at the end of the test control sample flow along the strip, it prevents the backflow of samples [6].Once the sample pad is saturated, the sample fluid dissolves and migrates to the conjugate pad, that contains antibodies specific to the target analyte conjugate to coloured particles [7].### Lateral flow test types:Sandwich assay format - Sample encounters conjugate labelled with antibodies specific to target analyte, when target is detected, conjugate antibodies will bind and reach the test line. When the line appears to be red, it means the chemical reaction has happened, as the visible change indicates. Competitive assay format - Used for small molecules, for instance, hormones, drugs. When sample encounters coloured particles labbled with target analyte. Test line contains antibodies to target and unlabelled analytes in sample will block the binding site, which prevents colour change, where colour band does appear.### Surface Plasmon Resonance

Surface Plasmon Resonance is the basis of measuring absorption of material onto a metal surface. It has been established as a powerful method to monitor label-free biomolecular interactions in liquids. It provides a means for identifying and quantifying equilibrium constants. The fundamental of SPR is when electro-magnetic wave propagating along the surface of a thin metal layer, the optical excitation of the Surface Plasmon is achieved. This is called Kretschmann configuration, when p-polarised, collimated light bean undergoes total internal reflection at a thin-metal interface [8]. The electron movements are now called plasmon, and they propagate parallel to the metal surface. The plasmon oscillation in turn generates an electric field [9].During the experiment, gluten molecule is immobilised on an SPR-active gold-coated glass slide which forms one wall of a thin flow-cell.The angle when the resonance occurs is very sensitive to any change in the reflective index of the medium that is adjacent to the metal surface, this change can be easily monitored using the intensity of reflected lights. ![](/images/glu/8.png)

As illustrated above, light is shined through the glass slide and onto the gold surface at conditions that fit SPR, the optical reflectivity is very sensitive due to the nature of gold, and the molecules present on the surface of the gold. The advantage of SPR is that it has high sensitivity without the aid of other labelling of the samples [9]. In SPR biosensors, probe molecules are firstly immobilized on to the sensor surface. When the solution of target molecules is flown into contact with the surface, a target analyte binding via affinity interaction occurs, which consequently induces an increase in the refractive index at the SPR sensor surface. SPR biosensor relies on the principle that any changes on the dielectric sensing surface will cause a shift in the angle of reflectivity, followed by a detector, in order to satisfy the resonance condition. Due to the sensitive nature of SPR biosensors, there are few conditions of the solution added need to be met in order to perform a successful test. Factors that affect SPR sensitivity [11]:•	Angular Sensitivity•	Dependence upon Prism Material•	Relative Index of Refraction Unit•	Surface Coverage•	Molar ConcentrationBy heating up the flour sample, the molar concentration of the solution has increased as water molecules would evaporate, therefore the SPR biosensor would become much more sensitive compare to the unheated one, since the only difference of the two solutions is one was heated. Thus, the faster reaction was observed and the high intensity of the Test Stripe.### Conclusion The aim of the project is to understand the fundamentals of biosensors, the differences between biosensors and biomedical sensors, and to understand the principles of Lateral Flow Assays as well as the principles of Surface Plasmon Resonance. By testing three sample solutions, the basics of biosensor testing was carried out. An experiment using commercially available biosensors was conducted, the investigation of gluten content presence of food samples was displayed by the biosensor. The awareness of highlighting gluten in food is important, due to the significant proportion of the population is gluten-intolerant, therefore, it is essential to have low cost and easy-to-use biosensors to test whether food contains gluten or not. GlutenTox Home Kit is a feasible and user-friendly lateral flow device that the public can use to detect gluten presence without the access to lab equipment and specific scientific knowledge. ### References:[1] N.
