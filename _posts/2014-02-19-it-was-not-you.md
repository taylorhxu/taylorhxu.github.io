title: It Was Not You
---

At 19, I moved to the UK to study. I scored 108 out of 120 in TOEFL before applying for schools, FYI that was high, especially so for a high schooler, but it meant nothing after I landed in this strong-accent-English-speaking foreign island. I was in Birmingham.

I struggled to understand the words coming out of my classmates' mouths, struggled to keep up, and struggled to form any responses. Even when I barely understood and replied, they seldom got what I was saying. 

It was very frustrating. It got more so when I started double, triple check the words I was using, and the grammar of every single sentence, to no avail. Even when I thought I said everything right, they still did not understand me. 

Was it my non-british accent? Or was it that the English ability I was proud of was actually completely imaginary and false?

Then, I met people who understood me. People who helped explaining what I said to the people who didn't understand me. They told me, actually, there was nothing wrong with my English, they weren't exceptionally good at guessing broken English. Those people who said that they didn't understand me, had it in their mind that, my English will not make sense, so it didn't.

It was at that point, I started to see, it was probably not my fault most of the time.

There are people who are convinced you can't do certain things because of the way you are. So even when you did it, they still find a way in their mind to reject the facts.

They are not bad people, it is just the way things are for them. Until you can prove it again, again, and again, til they notice, or until there are people around who help convincing these people, they will keep on rejecting you.

**No, it was not you.**<br/>
What a nice thing to know.

At times it becomes obvious that these people are not even trying to perceive the fact that, against all their beliefs, we might actually be very good at this certain thing that we do.

However, it is equally easy make the same mistake these people make. Let's at least try to do better, OK?
