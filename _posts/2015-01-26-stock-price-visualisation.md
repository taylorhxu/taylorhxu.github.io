# Overview

This application is actually a modified and advanced version of an existing stock tool which is listed on [Shiny's tutorial series](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson6/).

This app uses R's `quantmod` package, which detailed information can be found [here](http://www.quantmod.com/).
