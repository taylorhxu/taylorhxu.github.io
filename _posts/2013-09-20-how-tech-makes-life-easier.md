Most of you may have all of the following accounts: Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Instagram, Dropbox and Skydrive. But are you tired of updating all these accounts manually? Even sometimes accidentally post something should be on that specific account? Or you are looking for a better way to connect with your friends but not spending quite as much time? Here comes the solution: [ifttt.com](http://ifttt.com/)

I was lucky enough to get an invitation to join IFTTT when it was launched in late 2010. Since then, it has helped me with minimising time spent on organising social media accounts.
IFTTT stands for “if this then that”, it enables customers to connect their social media services as “channels”, by setting up “recipes” to make the Internet to work for you. Some examples as follows:

I am a bit OCD that everything should be in order and well organised, I always get annoyed by Instagram only allows browsing pictures online but not saving them. I know all the photo taken are saved in photo stream on iPhone, but I still need to import them then get them on the laptop, which is quite annoying . Therefore the first recipe shown works perfectly well for me. All my Instagram photos are automatically saved in my private SkyDrive folder.
IFTTT is not just a medium that links all your accounts together, some people may say that as they think setting up an IFTTT account is not worth the time, but actually it is. It doesn’t just automatically updates your tweets or facebook status which these services have already have the option to do so, but it is an easier and even safer way to organise.
Personally I am not a Twitter addicted, but many of my friends are, due to the inevitable peer pressure, I set up a Twitter account but I rarely update it. Honestly I don’t see the point of tweeting but I appreciate my friends’ choice, the only thing I would like to share presumably is music that I loved on Last fm.

(Just a quick explanation on why am I using Last fm, otherwise I would go into it and make another tedious post on Last fm which might be considered as advertising. I am making playlists, for friends, family and the important ones. I need to know songs I have loved if I am not able to add them to my playlist on Spotify immediately.)
This is what you see when the trigger works itself.

Just another example:

I occasionally find some places (i.e restaurants, bars..) I have been to are quite nice and worth going. Thus, I always recommend these places to my friends. The recipe shown that records my every single check-ins into a spreadsheet with time, location description and surprisingly the map is recorded as well. This allows me to check places I have been to in just one single spreadsheet, constantly scrolling down on the phone will never happen again!
A sample check-in FYI.
