I'm going to give a talk in the CUEB on some topics in the discipline of statistics at the invitation of the Association of Statistics of CUEB, and I've mainly prepared two topics for them: one is about those jokes from [Prof. Gary's gallery of statistics jokes](http://www.ilstu.edu/~gcramsey/Gallery.html), and the other is about some tools for the research of statistics. Below are materials for this talk:

- Slides for "[Jokes in Statistics](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/yihui.github.com/Jokes-2007-Yihui-Xie.pdf)" (English, PDF by LaTeX);
- Slides for "[A Leisure Look on Some Tools for Statistics](https://github.com/downloads/yihui/yihui.github.com/Stat-tools-2007-Yihui-Xie.pdf)" (_Chinese_, PDF by PowerPoint) and [code](https://gist.github.com/1756901);

If there are any errors in these materials, please tell me (through email `x@y` with `x = xieyihui` & `y = gmail.com` or leave a message here directly). Thanks!

P.S. The time of this talk has been decided now: Nov 1st, 2007. For details please refer to: <http://cos.name/cn/topic/8122>
