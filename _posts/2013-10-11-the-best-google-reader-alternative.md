*Very sad news. Indeed.7 months earlier, on the 13th March 2013, Google announced that Google Reader will be closed on July 1, 2013, due to declining use.*

I have been using Google Reader since September 2009, I pretty much rely on Google Reader for news, blogs I followed on Blogspot, and more. But now you are telling me the unexpected closure is due to declining use. Well I might be the minority who still uses Google Reader then. Anyway, as a “technology geek”, technically, I have started my experiments on varies Google Reader alternatives.
The first one I tried was Zite, I am sorry, I don’t like it at all. So in this review, I am going to compare the most two common choices that I can think of, which turns out to be Flipboard and Feedly.
Note: All the tests done are based on iPad application, which I thought is a common device to use these applications.
### Design
I am not sure about the others, but I am a relatively “picky” person that I need an app which suites me very well, somehow minimalism becomes the most important part of my life.

The one shown above is Flipboard. Flipboard is a magazine-like social-network aggregation.
Flipboard uses the bright red colour that makes readers feel excited and perhaps some readers may get an adrenaline rush. I personally don’t like this rather annoying red colour, I JUST WANT TO READ. Also, on the right hand side, you can see many categories that you can choose from and find interesting stuff to subscribe.

Let’s take a look at Feedly. Feedly is a news aggregator application for various Web browsers and mobile devices running iOS and Android. It compiles news feeds from a variety of online sources for the user to customize and share with others.
Feedly’s light green colour gives me a good impression about this app, because a Reader is for reading, and this light green colour really makes you want to read, at the same time, I believe psychologist may say that as well. But on the other hand, I have seen comments online saying “Can’t read linkes due to light green colour”, I haven’t experienced that problem so far, but I think an improvement that Feedly could make is let the users to choose their own theme colour.
### Content
Flipboard is a magazine formatted application. It collects the content of social media and other websites and presents it in magazine format and allows users to “flip” through their social-networking feeds and feeds from websites that have partnered with the company.

That’s what your Flipboard page is going to look like. It is very well organised, all sections are manageable and you can change the order of these “magazines”.

Feedly is just look like your old Google Reader, but with colours. All categories are listed on the left with unread numbers, nothing has changed much. If you are an old-fashioned person like me, you will love Feedly.
### Social 
As you may already seen, on one of the screenshot I used before, Flipboard allows you to connect with your social media accounts and get updates immediately.

Taking the risk of showing all my accounts here! But no worries, nothing confidential. You can link almost all your social media accounts and get updates, even for Chinese users, you can add your Renren (Chinese version of Facebook) and Weibo (Chinese version of Twitter) accounts to Flipboard.

Unfortunately, Feedly only allows users to link their “Reading” accounts such as Pocket and Instapaper, the only instant sharing method is Twitter. But the good thing is Feedly is for reading, 100%.
### Overall
1. Flipboard is social networking focused, Feedly is reading focused.
2. Flipboard requires user registration, Feedly allows Google Reader sign-in.
3. Flipboard is a mobile devices’ app, Feedly has a Google Chrome Browser extension version.
According to [VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/01/feedly-3m-users-new-mobile-apps/), Feedly clocks in 3M new users after Google Reader’s retirement, revamps apps. 3M, I think which is understandable. To be honest, most of the Google Reader lovers including me myself, the top reason of using Google Reader is the clean reading format. Apps like Flipboard sometimes distract me, it might be my own fault that linking Facebook accounts with Flipboard, but why not? Do I really need to sign-in to share an inspiring post then sign out just to prevent myself from browsing Facebook friends updates? I mean, if you are a true reader, use Feedly.
Comment: design-wise I would go for Flipboard, content-wise probably Feedly, social-networking definitely Flipboard.
