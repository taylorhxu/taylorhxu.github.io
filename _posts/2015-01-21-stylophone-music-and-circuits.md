summary: Recently I got very interested in music electronics. As a part of my course, I am familiar with electronic circuit design. To feed off my curiosity, I bought a stylophone, and I am going to build one myself.

A stylophone is a hand-held, small analog monophonic instrument, a stylus-operated keyboard. It was invented and first introduced to the public in 1960s, sometimes it’s referred as the world’s first mass-produced synthesiser.
