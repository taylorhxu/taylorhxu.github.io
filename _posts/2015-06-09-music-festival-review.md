summary: It was such a great festival, ice cream vans everywhere, not to mention the sun, and the anticipation for the London’s biggest, possibly the earliest summer party has reached apparent new heights, across ten stages. For two days every year, Victoria Park which located in East London, transforms into a mini English version of Coachella, but without campsite.

It was such a great festival, ice cream vans everywhere, not to mention the sun, and the anticipation for the London’s biggest, possibly the earliest summer party has reached apparent new heights, across ten stages. For two days every year, Victoria Park which located in East London, transforms into a mini English version of Coachella, but without campsite.

The line-up was great, headlined by Caribou, Patti Smith, and recent returned Oxford shoegazing band Ride, also along with Brit Award Female Solo Artist FKA Twigs, Canadian indie pop singer Mac DeMarco, New York rock band DIIV, BBC Music Sound of, 2015 nominee Shura with many others.

Anyone keeps up with the BBC Sound of award would know Aleksandra Denton (stage name Shura), her fantastic songwriting tricks mix with shimmered new wave textures lead her way up to a fixture on radio playlists. Both Jungle DJ set and performance at Shacklewell Arms Stage were impressive, although the allocated time slot was quite early — most people entered the park around 2pm, there were still a good amount of engaging audience present bring great vibe to the festival.

Buenos Aires born, Brooklyn Based singer-songwriter Valerie Teicher, best known by her stage name Tei Shi, is a raising star. Already presents as a guest artist on the track “Holiest” by Glass Animals, an English band, Tei Shi’s genre-smashing capability is only expanding. Sultry 60s ft. electronic 80s, not to mention the 90s alternative, all being experienced.

P.S.: Based on a quick conversation with Tei Shi, She may consider a UK tour by the end of 2015.

Saturday’s line-up skews towards the younger, more electronic and more indie. The packed line-up mean there were plenty clashes — FKA Twigs and Caribou. But luckily, Field Day unlike the overcrowded Glastonbury, it doesn’t take long to get to other stages. Both Twigs and Caribou did their set with ease. Twigs’s LP1 was one of the most exciting album of 2014, her live performance was incredible and thrilling, as few critics described as spectral soul. There are still chances to catch her again — Glastonbury and Bestival.

Mac DeMarco and the band probably had the best time slot for the Sunday afternoon, the weather was perfect — summery but not too humid. Not only the audience had fun, the band themselves had loads of fun too — by demanding the crowd participate in an attempt to break the world record of people on other’s shoulders, followed by the successful DeMarco crowd surf. The entire set was engaging and interactive — the crowd singing along with all the memorable tunes.
