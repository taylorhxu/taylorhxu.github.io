I am proud to announce that I joined [Le Wagon](http://www.lewagon.org) as the **CTO**. Le Wagon is a dev bootcamp teaching entrepreneurs who have had zero programming education how to build a web application using Ruby on Rails. This happens in Paris, and I have been a mentor and a teacher there since February.

My role at Le Wagon is now to make sure we deliver the best education possible to our students. I also design and implement the pedagogic platform supporting our teaching effort, making an heavy use of GitHub and their API / Webhooks (see [this article]({% post_url 2014-04-21-practical-example-of-using-git-in-a-school %})).

With two successful batches and one on the way this summer, we are very proud of our alumni and the projects bootstraped at Le Wagon. We believe coding is a critical skill to have in this 21th century. So don't waste any more time, [get on board](http://www.lewagon.org)!
