As United Nation reported recently, carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced significantly by second half of century to prevent climate disaster. 

In developing countries, most of the countries are generating electricity from burning fuels, such as coal. According to the US Energy Information Administration, on average, there are 211.1 lbs of CO2 per Million btu. The issue we are facing is that the power shortage in developing countries with the large amount of carbon dioxide is produced per kilowatt-hour when generating electricity with fossil fuels.

Carbon dioxide is widely known as the greenhouse gas, and it is causing serious climate problems. For reduction of carbon dioxide emission, an alternative way of generating electricity is needed. 

When vehicles are running on a special designed road hump, the kinetic energy generated by running vehicles can be transformed into electric energy. 

Taking traffic flow into consideration, in developing countries, truck drivers drive long distances and long hours due to the incomplete urban development. Therefore, there are a number of vehicles passing the road humps each day. By using rechargeable batteries, all the electric energy generated during the day are stored, which can be used later at night for lighting purposes, and during peak time, the electric energy perhaps can be used by nearby rural villages.

The detailed process is outlined as follows:

-  Running vehicles passing the hump, pressure levers under the humps are being pressurised, mechanical gear will rotate
-  Flywheel rotates 
-  Kinetic energy is accumulated and stored 
-  Stored kinetic energy forces electric generator to rotate
-  The rotation of coil and generated electricity are stored in rechargeable batteries 
-  Batteries are directly linked to the street lamps

This solution is easily achievable as in developing countries, highways are the main transportation route, therefore, there will be a large number of travel flow on those highways, considering longer direct sunlights in most of the developing countries, the electricity generated will be more than enough for maximum 8 hours of lighting. Also, highway maintenance happens regularly, hence replacing the existing humps by special designed humps is also doable.

At last, not only the developing countries could use this method to generate electricity and reduce carbon dioxide emission, recently UK has reported possible power shortage during the winter, in fact, all the countries in the world could start using this method and slow down the global warming, prevent natural disaster caused by such.
