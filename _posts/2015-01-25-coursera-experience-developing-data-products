First of all, I would like to send my grateful thank you message to the [JHU Data Science specialisation team](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) . I have signed up for R programming courses at the beginning of this year, as the course is coming to an end, I would like to share my experience. 

### Teaching style

Unlike other courses I have taken on Coursera, Data Science specialisation is an unique experience. 

### Shiny. by Rstudio
