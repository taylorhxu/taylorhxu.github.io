Last year I posted an animation created in R to celebrate the new year, and this year I've got a more fabulous animation ([available on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation))

The above animation comes from the `demo('fireworks')` in the R package `animation` 2.0-0. Thanks for the contribution of Weicheng Zhu.

Another demo I did not mention on this Christmas was `demo('Xmas2')`:

Thanks for the contribution of Jing Jiao.

There are a whole bunch of new features in the `animation` package v2.0-0 (this version is a milestone); please just go and check out them by yourself.
