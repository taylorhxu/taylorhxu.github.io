It is well-known that R has several graphics devices -- either the screen devices (`X11()`, `windows()`, ...) or the off-screen devices (`pdf()`, `png()`, ...). We can query the default graphics device in `options()`:

{% highlight r %}
getOption('device')
{% endhighlight %}

In a non-interactive session, the default device is `pdf()`. This is why Sweave has to create a file named `Rplots.pdf` _no matter if you want it or not_ when you run Sweave on an Rnw file which has code chunks creating plots. Such a behaviour is annoying to me -- the PDF file is not only unnecessary, but also time-consuming (creating this PDF file is completely a waste of time). Is there a way to set a "null" device? (like the `/dev/null` for *nix users) The answer is yes, but not so obvious. I have not found the device below documented anywhere:

{% highlight r %}
options(device = function(...) {
    .Call("R_GD_nullDevice", PACKAGE = "grDevices")
})
{% endhighlight %}

This device can speed up Sweave a lot when there are many plots to draw. Here is a comparison:

{% highlight r %}
x = rnorm(1000)
system.time({
    .Call("R_GD_nullDevice", PACKAGE = "grDevices")
    replicate(500, plot(x, pch = 1:21))
    dev.off()
})
#   user  system elapsed
#   1.51    0.02    1.53
system.time({
    pdf(file.path(tempdir(), "Rplots.pdf"))
    replicate(500, plot(x, pch = 1:21))
    dev.off()
})
#   user  system elapsed
#  47.81    0.20   48.10
{% endhighlight %}

One thing I don't understand in Sweave is that it evaluates the code chunk _twice_ if its Sweave options contain `fig=TRUE`. I think this might be a waste of time as well, and this is why I like [pgfSweave](http://cran.r-project.org/package=pgfSweave), which has both the mechanism of caching R objects (using **cacheSweave**) and a smart way to cache graphics (using pgf).

**WARNING**: this null device may not work with plots that contain (math) expressions! (take a look at `demo(plotmath)` in case you do not know what are expressions in R graphics)
