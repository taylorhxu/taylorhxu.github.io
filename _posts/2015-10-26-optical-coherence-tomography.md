### Introduction 

### Brief history of Optical Coherence Tomography

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive, high resolution, medical imaging technique has been widely adopted in the biomedical field, that obtains topographical images of human organs, based the coherence of light, from optical tissue interfaces, and uses the principle of optical interferometry [1]. 

During 1990-1991, two Japanese researchers, Naohiro Tanno of Yamagata University, Japan, and James G. Fujimoto, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States, independently developed the methods of OCT and submitted patent applications [2]. First performed in vitro observation of the retina and coronary artery were completed in 1991 [3].

OCT imaging has a number of attractive features that have already been used in a range of applications, based on the image resolution that OCT is able to achieve, of 1 to 15 µm, “one or two orders of magnitude higher than conventional ultrasound” [4], at the same time, imaging is possible to be performed both in situ and in real time, which enables guidance of excisional biopsy or interventional procedures.

1.2 Optical Coherence Tomography Compared to Ultrasound & MRI

Ultrasound has been a well-established medical imaging technique for the past few decades, it is used in a broad range of applications as it’s high-frequency characteristic allows sound wave to travel into the tissue and backscattered, by forming medical diagnostic images at different resolutions, which is determined by the frequencies of the sound wave. OCT is very similar to ultrasound imaging except in OCT, light beams are used instead of sound waves. The fundamental principal difference between ultrasound and optical imaging is the velocity of transmitted light is a million times faster than the velocity of a sound wave. In OCT imaging, the lights are used, as it is very sensitive to differences in terms of refractive index of optical scattering [4], this characteristic is beneficial in term of the distance within the tissue is measured and determined by the echo time delay of back scattered light waves, which requires fast time resolution. Although OCT has less penetration depth than ultrasound but it has the ability to provide micron level resolution [4]. OCT has great advantage over other medical imaging system, for instance, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), by having better imaging resolution and execution. As a 3D imaging technology, OCT currently fills the gap in imaging depth and resolution between ultrasound and confocal microscopy, Fig.1 [5].
