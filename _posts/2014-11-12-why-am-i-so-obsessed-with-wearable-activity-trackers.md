So, the title is clear enough. I am obssessed with wearble activity tracker. Fitbit, Jawbone UP, you name it, I’ve tried it.

This time last year I bought the fitbit Flex, with a stunning tangerine colour.

I wore the wristband 24/7 for about 2 months, before irritation rash had developed. I am sorry Fitbit, this was the main reason that I sold the tracker on eBay. Although I have sensitive skin, but Fitbit did have problems with the next product that launched after Flex. 

*Read The NY times news here: [Fitbit Recalls Force Device After Complaints of Rashes](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/21/fitbit-offers-a-voluntary-recall-of-force-after-complaints-of-rashes/?_r=0)*

But please don’t get me wrong, I am not trying to make negetive comments on Fitbit, in fact, I was excited about the new launching of three new devices. 

*On Wired: [Fitbit launching three new wearables](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-10/28/fitbit-announces-three-new-wearables)*

And yes, I did use the word “was”. The excitement went away soon after Jawbone launched its UP3.

As a biomedical engineering student, I am glad to see the bioimpedance technology has been used on a wearable health tracking device. My point of the industry is not developing a wristband that is small, shiny, tracking your heart beat, and your running distance, it is about a wearable device, that is small, shiny, waterproof, and it would give you all sort of data about your body. It is all about you.

That is just about right.

Maybe I am upset about all the Apple Watch, Microsoft Band. Those products are just simple fitness tracker that count your steps, check your heartbeat, and follow you on runs.

But I need MORE. A lot more.

Once my friend sent me a link on How the Napa earthquake affected bay area sleepers posted on Jawbone’s blog, I suddenly felt the urge to get a Jawbone fitness tracker. A company does its analysis based on the data its customers given, psychologically, it creates a good impression.

“Oh I didn’t notice that was because of the earthquake, I was wondering for a long time why I suddenly woke up that night.” Says one of my friend who lives in San Francisco.

Maybe I should change the title to “My data obsession”.

There are plenty fitness activity trackers on the market, the logical reason of getting one is that nowadays people just sit in front of their laptops, like what I am doing now, barely exercise. Therefore we needed a high-tech, fashionable wearable device to somehow to promote exercising, and restrain laziness.

Recent years, we go to the gym, because it is what the others do. We love organic food, because it is mainstream. What about wearables? of course. It is getting more and more popular.

But we shouldn’t use them just because it is trendy. We need to use it, for the sake of fitness.

I am off to gym.
