For a long time I've been wondering why we are not able to use Enter in the LyX Scrap environment which was set up by Gregor Gorjanc for Sweave. Two weeks ago, I (finally!) could not help asking Gregor about this issue, as I'm using ``LyX + Sweave'' more and more in my daily work. He explained it here: [LyX-Sweave: mandatory use of control+enter in code chunks](http://ggorjan.blogspot.com/2009/07/lyx-sweave-mandatory-use-of.html)

After digging into the LyX customization manual for a while, I found a solution which allows us to press the Enter key just as we normally do when typing in a LyX document. The key is to use `Environment` instead of `paragraph` as `LatexType` for the style definition of `Scrap`. Besides, I used the `LatexName` as `wrapsweave`, as a `LatexName` is required by LyX. The definition for `wrapsweave` is simple: just two empty lines by `\par`. (If you define it as `\newenvironment{wrapsweave}{}{}`, you will run into troubles sometimes; especially when you use indent for paragraphs.)

As we know, LaTeX environment cannot be centered in LyX (only paragraphs can), so I defined a special environment `ScrapCenter` when I want to insert graphics via Sweave and make them center-aligned.

To put all efforts together, this is the new `literate-scrap.inc` (compare it with [http://cran.r-project.org/contrib/extra/lyx/literate-scrap.inc](http://cran.r-project.org/contrib/extra/lyx/literate-scrap.inc)):

Enjoy pressing a single Enter key in LyX now! :)

P.S. the side effect of this modification is, your R code will be separated by empty lines. But Sweave will remove blank lines by default, so that is not really a big trouble.

P.P.S. Next time I will write my solution of using `pgfSweave` in LyX -- if you have never tried the `pgfSweave` package in R, I'd strongly recommend you do it right now!! My comment on this package is: amazingly beautiful!
