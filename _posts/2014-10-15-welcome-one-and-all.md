### Welcome!
Welcome, one and all.
First of all, welcome to my brand new site. This blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github. 

### Moving over from WordPress
I have started blogging with WordPress since 2009, it was a great experience and I have learned CSS, HTML all that stuff along the way. 

Forgot to mention I moved from wordpress.com to self-hosted WordPress in 2011, I have all my travelogs, book reviews, and projects over there. 

Here comes the reason(s). I have moved over from WordPress is that I have found *I only post few times a month*. In terms of photo sharing, I use [Flickr](flickr.com/photos/splendorevision/) and [Instagram](instagram.com/taylorhxu). Posting, I occasionally post on [Medium](medium.com/@taylorhxu) and my personal Tumblr blog. I have already had enough accounts to express my ideas, why do I need a blog that contains replicated posts and reviews? Let’s just forget it.

WordPress is great, and it has been working wonderfully, but it is just not for me:

1. Let’s be honest, I am a student, I don’t want to pay for the hosting. Why do I want to pay around £100 per year just for hosting somewhere.

2. Jekyll allows [markdown](https://medium.com/@taylorhxu/markdown-for-dummies-a24e982b8e85). I am writing this post using markdown, and I love markdown for two reasons:

1) Using plain text lets you concentrate on the words, rather than their formatting

2) It’s one of the most portable formats out there

I know WordPress allows markdown as well (started early 2014, if I remember correctly), but I am just fed up with all those plugins and updates with an error page shown afterwards.

3. Flexibility. I am not restricted to any template layout.

### Plan(s)
1. So my plans from now on is posting more frequently here, writing blog posts is also a good way to learn coding. Learning by doing.

2. I would like to move my charity project’s webpage using Jekyll with Github, but first of all I need to familiarise myself with Jekyll and Github.

Happy coding!
