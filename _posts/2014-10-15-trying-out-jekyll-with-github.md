### Welcome!
First of all, welcome to my brand new site. This so-called blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github. 

### Moving over from WordPress
I have started blogging with WordPress since 2009, it was a great experience and I have learned CSS, HTML all that stuff along the way. 

Forgot to mention I moved from wordpress.com to self-hosted WordPress in 2011, I have all my travelogs, book reviews, and projects over there. But I donâ€™t need WordPress anymore.

Part of the reason that I have moved over from WordPress is that I have found I only post few times a month. In terms of photo sharing, I use [Flickr](flickr.com/photos/splendorevision/) and [Instagram](instagram.com/taylorhxu).

### A long way

### The end
more stuff is coming.
