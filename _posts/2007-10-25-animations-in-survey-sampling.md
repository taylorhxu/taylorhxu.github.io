This afternoon I went to the Beijing Custom to give a lecture on sampling techniques as well as my R program. Actually I didn't make any preparations until late in this morning. When I finished my lunch, I made some animated pictures to illustrate these four kinds of sampling methods: simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling and systematic sampling.

After I came back to school, I added these animations to my little project [Animated Statistics Using R](http://animation.yihui.name).
