This demo was written by me about three months ago when I was illustrating the algorithm of [Gradient Descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) in the class of "Data Mining & Machine Learning". I like to combine iterations (or loopings) with animated pictures, because it's simple and heuristic, and of course, it's easy in R: just use `Sys.sleep()` to control the time of steps of your demonstration and some low-level graphics functions such as `lines()`, `points()`, `rect()`, `polygon()` and `segments()`, etc to illustrate the process of your algorithm. To understand the figure below, you need to be clear about what's `contour plot`.

Below is the code for the above example, and it has been included in the [**animation**](http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation) package as the `grad.desc()` function:

{% highlight r %}
op = par(pty = "s", mar = c(2, 1, 2, 0), cex.axis = 0.75, cex.main = 0.85)
x2 = x1 = seq(-2 * pi, 2 * pi, 0.1)
f = function(x, y) x^2 + 3 * sin(y)
contour(x1, x2, outer(x1, x2, f), col = "red", main = "")
mtext(side = 3, expression(z == x[1]^2 + 3 * sin(x[2])))
for (i in 1:3) {
  x = unlist(locator(1))
  s = 0.05
  newx = x - s * c(2 * x[1], 3 * cos(x[2]))
  eps = 0.001
  gap = abs(f(newx[1], newx[2]) - f(x[1], x[2]))
  while (gap > eps) {
    arrows(x[1], x[2], newx[1], newx[2], length = 0.075, col = "blue")
    x = newx
    newx = x - s * c(2 * x[1], 3 * cos(x[2]))
    gap = abs(f(newx[1], newx[2]) - f(x[1], x[2]))
    Sys.sleep(gap/3)
  }
}
par(op)
{% endhighlight %}
