I have recently written a piece for [The Hippo Collectve](http://www.thehippocollective.com/2015/09/25/chvrches-every-open-eye-review/) on Churches's new album.

We’ve been waiting for this album for so long.

Many of you would say Never Ending Circles sounds like a mix of The Mother We Share and Lies after one’s first listen, however, if you spend enough time listening to this song, you will get reminded of the phenomenon of Chvrches - clear, sharp and focused.

Few days prior the official release, Glaswegian trio Chvrches, comprised of Martin Doherty, Iain Cook, and famous lead vocalist Lauren Mayberry has already excited their fans with their second album, via NPR.

I am sure we all learnt this from a young age, almost all good things will reach an end, we are used to accommodate it - there are many times where the quality of each new song starts to fade, this album just keeps rising.

After ‘Leave a Trace’ video was met with misogynistic comments, Lauren Mayberry sat down with Cathy Newman for an interview on Channel 4, discussing the internet trolls, and she also said the following:

“Somebody tweeted me the other day, ‘If you can’t learn to deal with this sort of shit, stick a gun in your mouth before the record even comes out. I have one and I’ll give it to you.’ Personally, that’s horrifying, if somebody put that through your door, you would go to the police with that.”

I personally feel that Lauren Mayberry is experiencing a hard time during making this album, but Chvrches never fails us - something exciting happens. keyboardist and occasional vocalist Martin Doherty brightens the entire album by High Enough to Carry You Over. From an occasional to lead, Doherty did a good job, Which makes this album very special in the best way possible, or perhaps, this could be one of the biggest synth pop albums of the year.

Put on your best pair of headphone and turn up the volume, smashing yourself completely into Playing Dead, an artist that focused until the very last note, certainly understands quality songwriting - how to give songs decent bones.

Bury it reminds me a little bit of Purity Ring, Mayberry’s voice is astonishing, with the strong and solid base that Cook and Doherty provided underneath. This song is faster and sharper, comparing to the rest of the album, and also stronger. Mayberry’s voice radiated at the beginning of each song, Afterglow, giving us a more emotional and more dreamy texture.

For the past two years Mayberry has to deal with a lot of misogyny comments floating around Instagram, but this almost perfectly made record certainly is a comeback, thankfully Cook and Doherty stood by Mayberry’s side, they understand that music has transformative power, by writing powerful and meaningful lyrics, no doubt this album is going to make it to the best-selling records.

P.S. Chvrches starts touring in November.
