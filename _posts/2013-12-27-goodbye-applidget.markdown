After 1 year and 9 months of service, I am leaving [Applidget](http://www.applidget.com) to focus on my consulting career. I have been working on [MobiCheckin](http://www.mobicheckin.com/) with [@rpechayr](http://twitter.com/rpechayr), [@W_Deluche](https://twitter.com/W_Deluche), [@m7alleus](https://m7alleus) and [@Ahrryg](https://twitter.com/Ahrryg). I am proud of what we built, a robust, well-tested, full-featured SaaS product. For the stats nerds out there, here are some numbers:

Pivotal Tracker reports 90 sprints of one week including 763 stories (489 features, 214 bugs and 60 chores). Github reports 760 Pull Requests on the rails app repository. Those were busy times for sure!

I'm glad I was part of this great team, I learned a lot. Applidget let me become a Ruby on Rails expert. I also had the pleasure to assume the *Product Manager* hat regarding MobiCheckin, and provide my input to the roadmap.

I also want to thank [@CBarrault](https://twitter.com/CBarrault), our great executive assistant, [@_afournier](https://twitter.com/_afournier), [@jm_rolland](https://twitter.com/jm_rolland) and [@MickaelONILLON](https://twitter.com/MickaelONILLON), our awesome sales team, [@bcosset](https://twitter.com/bcosset), our MobiCheckin virtuoso, [@tildedash](https://twitter.com/tildedash) and [@b0baille](https://twitter.com/b0baille), two other great engineers in the team, and [@tristanverdier](https://twitter.com/tristanverdier), for hiring me last year. I wish you guys the best. Do you want to become a ruby on rails wizard? They are [hiring](http://www.applidget.com/pages/job_offers).
