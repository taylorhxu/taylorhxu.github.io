# Introduction 
Biopotential acquisition is a well-developed science, with the help of designed circuits and protection; ECG has become one of the main biopotential measuring method in the 21st century. By measuring the activities of the heart muscles, ECG is used in diseases diagnosis, and pre-recognition of potential risk of heart disease. Although with small amplitude and sometime noises, with special designed denoising method, filters and amplifiers, a complete ECG graph could be carried out, allows studying on the heart and medical uses.  The use of ECG in medicine and applications and the origin of biopotentials will be discussed. 
# How is biopotential generated
## The origin of biopotentials
Bioelectric potentials are generated as a result of electrochemical activity on a certain class of cells, known as excitable cells, that are components of nervous, muscular, or glandular tissue [1]. There are many organs in the human body; for instance, heart, brain and eyes manifest their functions via electric activity [2].  Electrical activity of excitable cells is carried by the flow of ions across the cell membrane. The human body has sensory receptors that convert external and internal stimulus into electrical signals. Sensory receptors responding to stimulus by detecting changes in the surroundings.

Electrocardiography (ECG), electromyography (EMG) and electroencephalography (EEG) measure the activities of heart, muscle and brain respectively, by measuring the electric potentials on the surface of the skin. Nervous stimuli and contraction of muscle can be measured and detected by measuring the ionic current flow of the body. The measurement is normally done by using a biopotential electrode [3].
## Anatomy and physiology: sensory receptors

![voltage gated pump](/images/biop/biop-1.png)

Neurons that respond to external and internal stimulus have very specialised cell surface membranes filled with channel proteins. At the same time, there are many factors that influencing the flow of ions across the cell membrane; first factor is the diffusion gradient. Ions travel from a region of higher concentration of ions to a region of lower concentration of ions, down the diffusion gradients. Second factor is the inwardly directed electric field, as across the membrane, the ions inside of the membrane are always more negatively charged than the outside, and the membrane is polarized. The cell surface membranes of the neurons are filled with channel proteins. These channel proteins are specialised sodium and potassium cannel proteins. The sodium-potassium pump, which is also voltage gated, actively transports sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell, and potassium (K+) into the cell. The active transport of ion across the membrane establishes an electrochemical gradient.
## How is action potential generated?
A nerve cell is made up of a cell body, an axon and dendrites. The cell body contains the nucleus and the axon the medium that the action potential is transmitting along with. The dendrites are responsible for receiving impulses in the form of neurotransmitters. All the cells communicate with each other via action potentials. A neurotransmitter is released when the action potential reaches a specific voltage.

![action potential](/images/biop/biop-2.png)

The action potential is generated by the polarisation of ions across the cell surface membrane via protein channels. Due to the inside of the cell surface membrane is always more negatively charged than outside, the influx of sodium ions enter the cell, which creates a generator potential. When there are more sodium ions enter the cell, and the depolarization phase cause the voltage reaches the threshold value at -40mV, a full impulse is generated. A full impulse, which is called the action potential, is usually around +40mV. 

However, when a neuron is not transmitting an action potential, it is at a state of resting potential. The state is established when there are more potassium ions inside the cell and more sodium ions outside the cell. At resting state, the resting potential is around -60mV.

From an electronically point of view, the cells exhibits a resting membrane potential, the Nernst equation is used for calculation of the equilibrium voltage for a particular ion under a certain concentration condition. Most of the time, the equation is used to predict the membrane voltage of a cell [5]. 

2.4 The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation

The cell surface membrane contains different protein channels, which allows different ions to pass through at the same time, therefore, the permeability of the membrane causes different values of membrane voltage, while different ions are entering or leaving the cell. However, there is no overall gaining or losing charges, the net current is balanced and it is remained zero [5].

Vi=0=(RT/F)*log_e⁡((Pk[Koutside]+PNa[Naoutside])/(Pk[Kinside]+PNa[Nainside] ))

Pk is the permeability of the cell surface membrane to Potassium and PNa is the permeability to Sodium.

Although the current is remained zero, but the fact at the cell surface membrane is constantly gaining sodium and losing potassium, therefore, the sodium-potassium pump is constantly pumping sodium and potassium ions in and out of the membrane.
## Transmission of an action potential 
As mentioned before, there are mainly sodium ions outside the cell and potassium ions inside the cell, also the polarity of the cell membrane suggests that the inside of the cell surface membrane is more negatively charged than the outside. As a result, when an action potential is induced, the influx of sodium ions depolarizing the specific section of the membrane, this event generates a local current of that section, that is a movement of charged particles within a cell down a concentration gradient. Therefore, the action potential is transmitted along the membrane, down to a region of lower concentration of the ions.

![equivalent circuit](/images/biop/biop-3.png)

Figure 3: From an electronic point of view, the equivalent circuit model for the cell models the cell membrane as a capacitor as it differentiate charges on the inside and outside of the cell. The protein channels and gates in the membrane that are in charge of the conductance of ions can be represented by resistance. As conductance is the inverse of resistance, the cell surface membrane is modeled as a resistor and capacitor in parallel.
## Electrical recording from a nerve fibre 

![invertebrate](/images/biop/biop-4.png)

The biopotential of all can be traced to the electric activity at a cellular level [8]. The changes of a membrane potential including depolarization, repolarization and resting potential, can all be detected by biopotential electrodes that are attached to the skin.

![penetrating](/images/biop/biop-5.png)

The electric activity can be measured by the recording electrode shown above in figure 5, after being amplified through an electronic amplifier, a graph can be given based on the data detected.

# Electrocardiogram(ECG)
Electrocardiogram is used to measure potentials on body surface due to neuromuscular activity of the heart.
## Electrocardiogram vs. other sensor sources

![comparison](/images/biop/biop-7.png)

By comparing different courses, ECG has relatively larger amplitude that would allow observers to see the waveform from the monitoring screen, and also a really wide range of bandwidth (Hz) can be carried out. Some of the ECG applications such as diagnosis purposes will be discussed later.
## The conduction of the heart

![conduction of heart](/images/biop/biop-8.png)

The human heart has four chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, the left atrium and the left ventricle. The two branches of the autonomic nervous system – the sympathetic and the parasympathetic – supply the heart. Sympathetic fibres innervate all the areas of the heart, but parasympathetic fibres main controls the SA node and AV node [11]. 

The rhythmic electrical activity of the cardiac impulse is originated in the SA node. Sympathetic nerve stimulation triggers the relsease of norepinephrine, which is a neurotransmitter that increases the heart rate by increasing SA discharge, As a result, the conduction time of AV node is accelerated, therefore the force of myocardial contraction and cardiac output are increased.

The transmission of electrical impulses depend on cardiac cells. Cardiac cells are excitable. The excitation of the cells is triggered by the movement of charged ions across the cell membrane, therefore affecting the cell’s ability to respond to electrical stimuli.

The SA node, which is located in the right atrium near the superior vena cava, is the pacemaker. Under the resting condition, impulses from 60-100 times/minute are generated. The impulse then propagates through intermodal and inter-atrial tracts. The transmission via right and left atria occurs rapidly, as a consequence, the pacemaker activity reaches the AV node in a organized way, as the atria contract almost simultaneously.

The AV node is located in the inferior right atrium. There is a short delay allowed for the ventricles to be filled with blood. Normally the cardiac impulse is delayed for 100 ms. Not only just allowing the filling phase, but also the stretching of cardiac muscle is also achieved. The short delay in the AV node allows enough time for completion of atrial contraction. Once the cardiac impulse reaches the bundle of His, a rapid conduction is reached; as a result, the initiation of ventricular activation over a wider range is stimulated.

Therefore, a highly efficient pumping action of ventricles is generated and the cardiac cycle completes.
## ECG monitoring
There are two types of monitoring ECG system used, hardwire monitoring and telemetry. The differentiation is that telemetry detecting electrodes can be placed anywhere on the skin, therefore a protection is achieved, since use hardwire monitoring may be faulty and resulting a electrical leakage that causes accidental shocks.

By placing electrodes directly onto the torso, arms and legs, ECG signals are detected. The activity on the body surface is known to reflect the activity and proximity of the heart muscle.

There is a lead system called the 12-lead system has been involved in clinical use [12,13]. It is a combination of electrodes that taking measurements from different locations: limb leads, precordial leads and chest leads. In general, the ECG signals at the surface of the body have really small amplitude, therefore, either high quality of electrodes or amplifiers are usually in consideration. Silver coated electrodes with silver chloride or sintered Ag-AgCl material are commonly used and recommended. At the same time, an electrolytic gel is applied on detection area of skin to enhance the conduction between the skin and the electrode. Also, electromagnetic interference created by the electrode-skin contact should been taken into consideration, the interference should be kept at a minimum level. Since ECG instrument are commonly used with high-voltage defibrillator, the protection from electrical shock need to be planed, all ECG instruments must be electrically isolated for safety reason [14].

![ecg](/images/biop/biop-9.png)

There are many different types of electrodes are suitable for particular biomedical applications. Electrodes have polarities, there are two types of electrodes: polarized and nonpolarised. Electrode polarisation would affect the ideal resulting waveform by an ohmic overvoltage, a concentration overvoltage, and an activation overvoltage. The ohmic overvoltage is that the voltage potential rises from the flowing current. The concentration overvoltage is a result of the alterations in the local ionic concentration around the electrode. The activation overvoltage is that the function of the electrode structure changing over time. Ideally, the polarisation of the electrodes need to be minimized, therefore the electrodes could have the same characteristics over time. Although a perfectly nonpolarised electrode doesn’t exist in the real world, but all electrodes are special designed as close to this as possible [15].

The Ag-AgCl electrode used for ECG is considered as nonpolarised. The lead that connected to the electrode also connects to an amplifier. A stable output over time is given and the DC recording performed has relatively low noise.
# Electrocardiogram in use
An ECG is used to measure:
1. Any damage to the heart
2. The heart rate
3. The effects of drugs or medical devices, i.e. pacemaker used to control the heart
4. The size and position of the heart chambers

Usually, an ECG test is performed when a patient has chest pain, palpitations, scheduled for surgery or medical history of heart disease.

![cardiac cycle](/images/biop/biop-10.png)

As the graph shown above, the QRS complex is the most important part of an ECG signal and it has a range of 0.5 to 4mV. The ECG has a frequency range of 0.01 to 250 Hz. The standard clinical bandwidth used for ECG signal is 0.05 – 100Hz. For monitoring applications, such as for intensive care patients and ambulatory patients, the bandwidth is restricted to 0.05 -50Hz.
# The use of ECG in medicine and applications
ECG amplifiers are needed in many applications, especially its medical application when monitoring in cardiac intensive-care units, when safety and electrical shock protection are extremely important. Even a very small amount of leakage current can put the patient’s life in danger, not to mention that the patient’s life in ICU is already critical. Additionally, the safety of the patient is achieved by providing an electrical isolation from the power line and the earth ground. 
## Diagnosing Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is that there is an extra pathway between the atria and ventricles; therefore, at the same time of electrical impulses passing from atria starting at the AV node, the impulses can also pass through the extra pathway. 

Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can be diagnosed by doing an ECG. There is a classic change on the delta wave that can be seen on patients’ ECG graph, due to the pre-excitation of the ventricles.
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is known as a pre-excitation syndrome. It can lead to a syndrome called supraventricular tachycardia because the unusual electrical impulse starts in the atria. Tachycardia is a heart rate >100 beats per minute [19].

![wpw](/images/biop/biop-11.png)

Figure 11: Leads I, II, III, V3 through V6 show classic features of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, with a short PR interval and a delta wave during sinus rhythm.

Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is more common in men than women, and the affected population is around 0.1%-0. 3%. Although the episodes of rapid heart rate could vary, but most of the people would notice the syndrome during their childhood.
### Electrical interference reduction 
ECG signals are very important while assessing the ECG graphs. However, environmental electric interference is always present, especially in hospital environment. Therefore, a electrical interference reduction circuit is needed.

![filtering](/images/biop/biop-12.png)

Filtering at the front of the ampliﬁer and limiting the bandwidth of the biopotential ampliﬁer can further help to reduce the interference.
## Electrocardiographic Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome in Patients With Endocavitary Pacemakers
In the 21st century, there are many patients that suffer from heart disease now have a chance to have an artificial permanent pacemaker helping them with daily life.

Patients with permanent pacemakers with the external stimulation on the right ventricle, a block on the ECG signal detected will show on the electrocardiogram, which increases the difficulty of identifying acute myocardial ischemia.

![acute ischemia](/images/biop/biop-13.png)

By comparing the graph, the ECG demonstrated a paced rhythm with stimulated complexes with left bundle branch block morphology, from the graph, when the ST segment is elevated and QRS complex has a low polarity, therefore there is a high chance that the patient has high risk of experiencing acute ischemia. 

![st segment](/images/biop/biop-14.png)

“In the ECG with right endocavitary pacing, both ST segment depression >1 mm in precordial leads with concordant QRS complex polarity, and ST segment elevation >5 mm with opposite QRS complex polarity presented low sensitivity for diagnosis (25% and 31%, respectively). However, specificity is very high (96% and 92%), so this finding represents a considerably excessive risk (odds ratio [OR] =6 and OR=4.3, respectively; <.05) and, therefore, a valuable diagnostic tool. The reduced sensitivity of these criteria increases considerably (67%) when the electrical changes are dynamic in relation to the episodes of pain.4 In the presented cases, the elevation of myocardial necrosis markers and the echocardiographic or angiographic findings confirm the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome indicated by the surface ECG [17].”
# Conclusion
As one of the main biopotentials that is used in both medical and commercial applications, ECG makes a great impact on people’s lives. By simply looking at the ECG graphs, some of the diseases can easily been found, not only comparing the graphs, also by improving the design and the engineering work of the devices, ECG can be as power as other complicated medical detecting devices. With filtering, electrical interference isolation and defibrillation protection, the safety of using ECG electrodes has been cut down to a minimum. 

Biopotential measuring devices require a good understanding of science and a well-designed engineering prospective.  This approach values the meaning of ECG in modern medicine. With good environment provided (less environmental interference), and circuit protection due to safety reason, ECG has become more and more important in the clinical practice. Biopotential measuring instruments can encounter very high voltages. With the development of ECG devices, by ECG denoising, filters and amplifiers, a much clearer results could be derived.
