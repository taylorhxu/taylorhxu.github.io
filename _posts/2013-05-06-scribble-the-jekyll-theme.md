**Update: 25 Sep 2012**

I decided it was too much work to add a new theme, and rather not destroy the joy of redesigning blogs by constraining myself with frameworks, so.. from now on the themes will be in [the repository of this blog](https://github.com/muan/muan.github.com), meaning if you do want to use it, it's going to take you some setup time, migrating posts or however you do it. 

One thing remains to be true: you're all welcome to use the themes I made, edit it however you like, only that I will not be doing support. 

Browse the design changes using this neat [release view](https://github.com/muan/muan.github.com/releases) of the repository. ♥

I am now working on **Wardrobe**, which would be a jekyll setup with 3-5 themes to start with, it is currently work in progress but you can have [a sneak preview here](http://themes.muan.co/) (one of the themes.)

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/muanchiou) or [GitHub](https://github.com/muan/jekyll-wardrobe) to keep yourself in the loop. ♥

Remember [this post](/2013/04/08/jekyll-themes/)? Yap, I have been busy, but it is no excuse. There is only one reason for why I didn't start the project -- It is too big to start. I failed to find a way in. 

How exactly do you make it easy for people to switch themes without turning this project into some huge monster? I don't know, and couldn't find the time to think about it thoroughly.

I thought about building the themes on top of [jekyll bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com). Well, it would be sensible, but no, not at this point at least. It would be a huge barrier for me in terms of kicking start this project, because then I'd need to understand how things are structured in jekyll bootstrap...

Therefore, I decided to keep it as simple as possible, just do basically what [Left](https://github.com/holman/left) (by [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com/posts/left/)) does, and it, is, done.

## Scribble.

So, Scribble is the first theme, read more about it on [the demo site](http://scribble.muan.co/2013/05/06/scribble-the-jekyll-theme/). 

That'll be all. :)
