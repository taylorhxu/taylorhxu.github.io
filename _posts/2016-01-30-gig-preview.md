Brooklyn based rock music trio Highly Suspect (Founded by twins Rich and Ryan Meyer, and their best friend Johnny Stevens in 2009) has picked up two Grammy nominations for Best Rock Album & Best Rock Song just last December, is making their first trip to the UK. Managed by In De Goot Entertainment, the band will be in the UK from the 27th January – 8th February, as part of The Carnival of Madness Tour as well as a handful of solo performances. The Carnival of Madness is a hard rock/alternative rock tour founded in 2010 with this 2016 run being the inaugural UK edition.

The literal band of brothers has started off playing cover set on the shores of Cape Cod, now living in Brooklyn. After recording a 3 song EP The Worst Humans with producer Joel Hamilton (Elvis Costello, Plastic Ono Band, Black Keys/Wu-Tang Clan), their debut album, Mister Asylum, is a reflection of experiences of the band members, “It’s losing your mind and finding yourself. That’s us. ” The record debuted at #56 on the Billboard Top 20.

Grammy nomination 2016: Best Rock Song – Highly Suspect, “Lydia”

In their single “Bath Salts”, Rich and Ryan play off their primal connection to hold down a rocking, tension filled rhythm section, while lead singer Johnny’s lo-fi vocals play into the songs’ themes of recklessness and wasted youth. “We have been rogue, nomadic, bohemian, and poor for years now, but we stay together because this life and this music is what we love”

The band will be headlining The Old Blue Last on 27th Jan and The Black Heart on 8th Feb to start and finish their UK tour. For a band has yet to set foot in the UK, their Black Heart show is already sold out. I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to go and see them at The Old Blue Last this week, and the review of the show will be up very soon.
