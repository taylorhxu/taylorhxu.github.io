This projects involves the designing, simplification and implementation of a fully functioning 4-bit full subtractor, in order to subtract 4-bit binary numbers. The process itself was split into three major sections that involved the construction of a 2-bit full subtractor and two 1-bit full subtractors. In order to do this, a truth table that can be used to optimise the number of gates used, through the use of boolean algebra or Karnaugh maps was devised. The resulting design was then implemented using a 2-bit and two 1-bit full subtractor circuits. Subtraction is one of the basic operations used in many digital systems. One of the most common being computers, where it is heavily involved in the arithmetic and logic unit (ALU).
