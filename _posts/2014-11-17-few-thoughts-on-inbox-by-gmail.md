summary: Inbox feels analogous to Perl. It’s a collection of clever, interesting, useful features, some of which have never been seen before. And, like Perl, there’s not just one way to use it, which makes it difficult for new users to understand how to use it best.

First of all I’d like to thank my friend Tommy who invited me. I was very excited that I got the chance to try this app. I have being using this app for about 4 weeks now, I’d like to share my thoughts.

Before using Inbox by Gmail, I used Mailbox as my main mail client. It gives me a more productive 
### Inbox is for people who uses mail client as to-do lists.
GTD. Isn’t that familiar? The methodology of GTD is time management, and task prioritising. 
1. You get an email, your deadline is next Friday, then you add that to your to-do-list. 
2. Sometimes you  are busy, you are thinking “I will deal with this issue after lunch” and it is 12:50. Then you can snooze the mail in 1 hour time.
### Inbox is for Gmail heavy-user
1. Collecting mails
2. Categorising mails
3. Setting a deadline

The concept showed promise. Users were able to more quickly find information related to the projects after time had passed, and they were better organized for the duration of the project. 

Google’s adaptation of the idea focuses on managing email rather than discoverability, however. They automatically group messages that fit into one of the Gmail tab categories (along with a few others) into bundles without further user input. Messages in bundles show up grouped in the Inbox as a single entry, which takes up about as much space as an unbundled email. You can mark all of the messages in a Bundle as “Done” (like Archiving in Gmail) with a single click.

There are two brilliant hidden features in Bundles as well — you can create filters to group specific messages into a Bundle, just as you could for a label in Gmail. You can also, in a clever improvement to functionality we built in Inbox Pause, set up specific Bundles to only appear at prescheduled times. I think this is incredibly valuable, but discovery will be hard because it’s buried, nondeterministic, complicated, and requires a lot of configuration. If Google can express that functionality in a simpler way, it could be a huge win.

The Gmail team highlighted that Inbox was designed from a mobile-first standpoint, and it shows. Viewing messages is elegant on mobile. On the web, it uses an accordion display where emails collapse and expand within the list of emails. It feels like a bizarre choice, adding clicks in many cases and making it hard to just read an email. Google also moved even further in the direction of making email feel like chat in the Inbox compose experience, which works well on mobile, but less well on the web.

Overall, Inbox feels analogous to Perl. It’s a collection of clever, interesting, useful features, some of which have never been seen before. And, like Perl, there’s not just one way to use it, which makes it difficult for new users to understand how to use it best.
 
I don’t think Google can retroactively shoehorn a guiding opinion into an already-released product that feels like collection of interesting features. They were never able to do so with Google Plus. So as Google knocks the rough edges off the new features and figures out how users interact with them in the wild, I expect the evolution of Inbox will bring it closer to the standard Gmail experience.

That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Gmail has evolved to look a lot more like regular email since its release in 2004. Google added a Move button to make labels behave more like folders. Delete buttons returned. Threading can be disabled. It even received an Outlook-style Preview Pane.

But the advances that it made — message threading, fast full-text search, not having to spend time managing your email quota, etc. made email much better. They have become cornerstones of every email experience. I expect that will be the legacy of Inbox as well.
