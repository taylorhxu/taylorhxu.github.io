### Welcome!
First of all, welcome to my brand new site. This so-called blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github. 

### Moving over from WordPress
I have started blogging with WordPress since 2009, it was a great experience and I have learned CSS, HTML all that stuff along the way. 

Forgot to mention I moved from wordpress.com to self-hosted WordPress in 2011, I have all my travelogs, book reviews, and projects over there. 

Here comes the reason(s). I have moved over from WordPress is that I have found *I only post few times a month*. In terms of photo sharing, I use [Flickr](flickr.com/photos/splendorevision/) and [Instagram](instagram.com/taylorhxu). Posting, I occasionally post on [Medium](medium.com/@taylorhxu) and my personal Tumblr blog. I have already had enough accounts to express my ideas, why do I need a blog that contains replicated posts and reviews? Let’s just forget it.

WordPress is great,and it has been working wonderfully, but it is just not for me:

1. Let’s be honest, I am a student, I don’t want to pay for the hosting. Why do I want to pay around £100 per year just for hosting my wonderful blog right?
2. Jekyll allows [markdown](https://medium.com/@taylorhxu/markdown-for-dummies-a24e982b8e85). I am writing this post using markdown, how wonderful it is. I know WordPress allows markdown as well(only started recently, if I remember correctly), but I am just fed up with all those plugins and updates.
3. Github offers free hosting. Link back to my first point, I can surely afford £10 for the domain. And also I can have version control with Github, awesome!

### Plan(s)
1. So my plans from now on is posting more frequently here, writing blog posts is also a good way to learn coding. 
2. I would like to move my charity project’s webpage using Jekyll with Github, since now I am more likely to have a ‘hate’ relationship with WordPress not ‘love’.
3. Just keep it with 2 points for now.
