Hello,

My name is Taylor Xu, a biomedical engineering student who has experience in data science and analytics.

My main academic interest lies in the field of computational neuroscience & artificial intelligence applications for improved biomedical engineering, and also I enjoy photography, travelling, and foreign languages.

At the same time, I have specific interests in statistics, data analysis, medical informatics, biomaterials, nanotechnology, algorithm and building computational tools.

L2C is an online initiative we have involved overseas Chinese students to tutor Chinese students in the area of essay writing. Tuition is offered free of charge by volunteers studying at universities in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The tutees make a small donation to a partner NGO. As a co-founder and CTO, a website was designed by me using WordPress as a platform for booking volunteers and submitting sample works, as well as providing general information.
