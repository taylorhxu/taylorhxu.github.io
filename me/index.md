This is my personal site, including all my posts on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@taylorhxu) and other relevant works.

I am a biomedical engineering student at City University London, tech enthusiast, music festival goer & former London 2012 cast, I write for The Hippo Collective.

My main academic interest lies in the field of computational neuroscience & artificial intelligence applications for improved biomedical engineering, and also I enjoy photography, travelling, and language learning.

I have specific interests in statistics, data analysis, medical informatics, biomaterials, nanotechnology, algorithm and building computational tools.
