### Web Construction and Management

Sept 2003 - Present

I have made and been maintaining web pages for:

- [The School of Statistics](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/), Renmin University of China (Sept 2003 - Jun 2009)
- [The Center for Applied Statistics](http://www.applstats.org/), Renmin University of China (Apr 2004 - Jun 2009)
- The Center for Risk Management and Actuarial Studies (Jun 2004 - Apr 2006); Data Mining Center of Renmin University of China (Jul 2004 - Apr 2006), etc
- The "Great Expectation Society", a student society in Renmin University (Mar 2005 - Jul 2006)

I have built and been hosting this web forum:

- "[Capital of Statistics](http://cos.name/)" for web discussion of statistics (both [Chinese](http://cos.name/) and [English](http://cos.name/en/)) (May 2006 - Present)

I have been working in these web studios:

- The English web studio of Renmin University of China (for the construction of English website of the university) (Sept 2006 - Jun 2009)
- The web club of the School of Statistics (as the founder & leader) (Apr 2006 - 2008)

My own projects:

- AniWiki: Animations in Statistics (<http://animation.yihui.name/>)
- knitr: Elegant, flexible and fast dynamic report generation with R (<http://yihui.name/knitr>)

### Conferences Organization

Feb 2005 - Present

I organized

- the 1st Chinese R [conference](http://cos.name/2008/12/1st-chinese-r-conference-summary/) (in Beijing), Dec 13~14, 2008

and I helped organize these conferences:

- the 3rd Chinese R [conference](http://cos.name/chinar/chinar-2010/) (Beijing), Jun 12~13, 2010
- the 2nd Chinese R [conference](http://cos.name/chinar/chinar-2009/) (Beijing & Shanghai), December 2009
- Second [Conference](http://www.merit.unu.edu/MEIDE/) on Micro Evidence on Innovation in Developing Economies, April 22 ~ 23, 2008 (an international conference; I was also the Chair for the last session on April 22)
- 2nd [Conference](http://www.applstats.org/english/io/index.htm) on Australia-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA): Econometric Modeling and Policy in Trade, Investment and Economic Integration, April 17th ~ 18th, 2006
- 15th International [Conference](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/en/21940.html) on Input-Output Techniques, June 27th ~ July 1st, 2005
- Data Mining and Business Intelligence Conference 2006
- International Statistics [Forum](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/en/22120.html) 2006

### Statistical Consulting

May 2005 - Present

I offer statistical consulting by email and I have been answering questions in the [Capital of Statistics](http://cos.name/cn/) almost every day. I'm particularly interested in these topics:

- data analysis and visualization
- theoretical problems without measure theory
- linear models, generalized linear models and nonlinear models
- R packages that I maintain (other questions on R should go to R-help or StackOverflow)
- statistics in other disciplines (e.g. biology) in which I can also learn something from you
- real world data mining
- simulation
- teaching

I will ignore any questions on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) or factor analysis, as I do not believe their usefulness at all. I know little about time series and do not like econometrics.

### Other Work Experience

## Computer Skills

I like playing with computer tools for building web pages and statistical computation & graphics. I improve the efficiency of my work with the aid of programming (i.e. work hard to be lazy).

- Statistical Packages: [R](http://www.r-project.org/), OpenBUGS (<del>S-Plus, SPSS, Eviews, SAS, MatLab, STATA, AMOS and LISREL</del>)
- Languages: R, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, SQL (<del>Visual Basic, VBA, VBScript, ASP, Java, C</del>)
- Applications: LaTeX, [LyX](http://www.lyx.org), databases (e.g. MySQL), SVN and GIT
- Operating Systems: 97.5% GNU Linux ([Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)); 2.5% Windows

Listed above are what I'm very familiar with, and the ones being crossed out are due to my brain stack overflow and I do garbage collection in my brain once in a while. Occasionally I also use other tools like [jStat](http://www.jstat.org/) and [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/). I'm insterested in learning Python. If I have more time to kill, I will definitely learn [http://processingjs.org/](Processing.js).

## Software Packages

I support open source software and below is a list of my contributions to the open source community:

- Wordpress plugin [UTF-8 DB Converter](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/utf-8-db-converter/) (June 2009)
- Dokuwiki plugin [animation](http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:animation) to insert animations into wiki pages; written in PHP and JavaScript (Jun 2008)
- R package [animation](http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation) which provides several animation demonstrations for statistical theories and data analysis (Nov 2007 - Present)
- R package [knitr](http://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr) as an alternative to Sweave for dynamic report generation
- R package [testit](https://github.com/yihui/testit) for testing R packages
- R packages [formatR](http://cran.r-project.org/package=formatR), [Rd2roxygen](http://cran.r-project.org/package=Rd2roxygen), [R2SWF](http://cran.r-project.org/package=R2SWF), [MSG](http://cran.r-project.org/package=MSG), [iBUGS](http://cran.r-project.org/package=iBUGS), [fun](http://cran.r-project.org/package=fun), ...
- R package [cranvas](https://github.com/ggobi/cranvas/) as the next generation of [GGobi](http://www.ggobi.org) for interactive statistical graphics
- the Sweave and knitr modules in LyX
