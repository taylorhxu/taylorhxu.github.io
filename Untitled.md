In the meantime please remove this address from your ASOS account, for security reasons I can't change your address. To make any changes to your address please log into 'http://bit.ly/28KHW88'. Once you're in, click 'Edit' in the relevant box, and you'll be able to change any details (remember to click the 'Save' button when you're done) and tick your current address as default
